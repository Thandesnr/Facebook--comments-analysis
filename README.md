# Project Title: Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project leverages various Python libraries to conduct **descriptive analysis**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **data manipulation**, and **visualization** of data. The code uses a combination of standard libraries and advanced tools like **seaborn**, **plotly**, and **scikit-learn** to analyze and visualize datasets effectively.

The project aims to provide insights into datasets by using statistical techniques and machine learning tools, performing data cleaning, and visualizing the results with various charts.

## Libraries Used

Below is a list of libraries used in the project:

- **Random**: For generating random numbers for simulations or sampling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling arrays and matrices.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive plots.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping and parsing HTML content.
- **JSON**: For handling JSON data.
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: For pattern matching and string manipulation.
- **String**: For string operations.
- **Math**: For mathematical operations.
- **spaCy**: For natural language processing tasks.
- **Datetime**: For date and time manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks like feature extraction.
- **SciPy**: For advanced statistical tests and calculations.

## Steps Included in the Analysis

### 1. **Descriptive Analysis**
Descriptive analysis involves summarizing the key characteristics of the dataset. This includes calculating basic statistical metrics like:
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Standard Deviation
- Quartiles, Percentiles
- Distribution and Frequency

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
In the EDA phase, various techniques are used to uncover patterns in the dataset, including:
- Handling missing values
- Outlier detection
- Correlation analysis
- Data distribution visualization using histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots.

### 3. **Data Manipulation**
Data is cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for analysis:
- Filling or dropping missing values
- Data normalization and scaling
- Creating new features from existing ones
- Encoding categorical variables

### 4. **Statistical Testing**
The project uses various statistical tests to evaluate hypotheses and validate assumptions. This includes:
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: To test the normality of the data.
- **Pearson Correlation**: To analyze the linear relationship between numerical variables.
- **T-tests** and other hypothesis testing methods from the SciPy library.

### 5. **Data Visualization**
Data visualization techniques help in better understanding the underlying patterns and relationships in the data:
- **Seaborn**: For statistical plots like heatmaps, pairplots, and distribution plots.
- **Matplotlib**: For customizing plots and creating line charts, bar charts, and more.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations like scatter plots and line charts that allow users to zoom and hover for more details.
